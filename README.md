# NHL Database Scripts Repository

These scripts are used to scrape the NHL results from the day before. They are built upon
the excellent [Hockey Scraper package](https://github.com/HarryShomer/Hockey-Scraper) built by
Harry Shomer. Using his scrape they scrape the the game ids from the day before and then calculate
all strength states player individual and onice stats, team stats, and goalie stats. Once the
stats are calculated they are then inserted into my PostgreSQL database.
